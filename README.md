## Result and Analysis
### Revenue Growth
![revenue overtime CAGR jpg_Page_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c77e375e-4f5b-4e7a-aa6c-04229afe94ee)

The revenue trend analysis from 2019 to 2024 showcases a remarkable growth trajectory. Starting with a modest $0.07M in 2019, revenue grew exponentially by 257% to $0.25M in 2020. Although the YoY growth moderated in subsequent years, it remained robust at 63% in 2022 and 58.67% in 2023. In 2024, revenue surged by 100% YoY, reaching a peak of $2.38M. This dramatic increase likely reflects successful product innovations or significant market expansions. Over the six-year period, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) stands at an impressive +79.99%, highlighting consistent and sustained business growth. The trend underscores the company’s strong upward trajectory and its potential for long-term scalability.

### Analysis of AOV and Yearly Active Customers (2019-2024)
![AOV AND YAU](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/871fcf2f-8f24-4bdf-8ef3-a56f156ba5c0)

1. AOV (Average Order Value):
-	Trend: The AOV shows a slight decline from 2019 to 2024, decreasing from 172 in 2019 to 163 in 2024, which is a 5.23% drop.
-	Interpretation:
    -	The slight decline in AOV may indicate that customers are making purchases with lower transaction values or there is a shift in product preferences.
    -	Other contributing factors could include the implementation of discounts or changes in pricing strategies over the years.
________________________________________
2. Yearly Active Customers:
-	Trend: The number of active customers has grown significantly, from 2,000 in 2019 to 57,000 in 2024, an increase of over 28 times in just six years.
-	Interpretation:
    -	This rapid growth in customer base reflects strong business expansion, effective marketing strategies, and increased brand awareness.
    -	It likely indicates a focus on aggressive customer acquisition efforts.
________________________________________
3. Relationship Between AOV and Yearly Active Customers:
-	While the number of active customers has grown exponentially, AOV has not shown a proportional increase. This suggests the business has prioritized increasing transaction volume (customer quantity) over raising the average transaction value.
-	With a rapidly growing customer base, there is significant potential to optimize AOV through strategies like cross-selling, upselling, or introducing higher-value product offerings.
________________________________________
4. Challenges and Opportunities:
-	Challenges:
    -	A stagnant or declining AOV could impact profit margins if customer acquisition costs rise or operational costs increase.
    -	Ensuring that rapid customer growth translates into sustainable profitability is critical.
-	Opportunities:
    -	A large customer base provides opportunities to enhance customer loyalty, drive repeat purchases, and implement strategies to boost AOV.
    -	Segmentation of the customer base could allow for targeted offers and promotions tailored to specific customer needs.
________________________________________
5. Recommendations:
    1.	Customer Segmentation: Analyze the customer base to identify groups (e.g., new vs. returning customers) and offer tailored products or bundles to boost AOV.
    2.	Loyalty Programs: Launch loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases and incentivize larger transactions.
    3.	Introduce Premium Products: Add higher-value products or services to increase the average order size.
    4.	Optimize Marketing Strategies: Shift the focus of marketing efforts to not only acquire new customers but also retain existing ones and increase transaction values.
    5.	Leverage Data Analytics: Use customer behavior data (e.g., purchasing patterns, timing, and preferences) to inform decisions and refine strategies.

### Analysis : New Customer vs Returning Customer (2024)

![new vs returning customer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb2003a-088c-4ff9-95a7-72c309ce4603)

1. Overview
The data shows the monthly distribution of new customers and returning customers from January to November. Returning customers consistently form the majority, but the proportion of new customers increases over time. Below are detailed observations:
2. Key Observations
    1.	New Customers:
        -	Steady Growth:
            New customer numbers increased consistently from 740 in January to 1680 in November.
            -	Largest month-over-month growth: November (+340 customers).
            -	Percentage increase from January to November: 127%.
    2.	Returning Customers:
        -	Steady Dominance:
            Returning customers make up the larger share, ranging between 2700 in February to 6200 in November.
            -	Largest month-over-month growth: October to November (+940 customers).
            -	Percentage increase from January to November: 125%.
    3.	New vs Returning Customer Share:
        -	January: New customers constituted 21.1%, while returning customers formed 78.9%.
        -	November: New customers increased to 21.3%, while returning customers held 78.7%, maintaining a similar ratio.
3. Trends and Patterns
    1.	Growth Correlation:
        -	Both new and returning customer segments grew steadily across the months, indicating that efforts to acquire new customers and retain existing ones were successful.
    2.	Returning Customer Dependence:
        -	Despite the increase in new customers, the business remains heavily dependent on returning customers, contributing consistently over 75% of total customers each month.
    3.	Accelerated Growth in Q4:
        -	Both new and returning customers show sharper growth in October and November, possibly driven by seasonal promotions or holiday campaigns.
4. Recommendations
    1.	Leverage Returning Customers:
        -	Enhance loyalty programs to further boost retention and reward frequent customers, as they form the bulk of the customer base.
    2.	Focus on New Customer Growth:
        -	While the number of new customers is growing, its proportional share remains stagnant (~21%). Strengthen acquisition campaigns (e.g., referral programs, first-time purchase discounts) to increase this percentage.
    3.	Boost Engagement in Q4:
        -	Continue leveraging the momentum from October–November campaigns to maximize customer growth during peak seasons.

### Cohort Retention Rate in 2024
![cohort chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce23f454-f83c-4bc1-b7bd-d4cd74feb3c9)

1. Retention Trends
-	Gradual Decline:
    Retention generally decreases as time progresses, which is expected. Earlier cohorts (January–June) exhibit a more balanced decline in retention compared to later cohorts.
-	Peak Retention Periods:
    o	July and August cohorts stand out with higher retention rates in months 2–4, maintaining above 7%, suggesting better engagement strategies during those periods.
    o	The June cohort has the highest Month 2 retention rate (8.81%) among early cohorts.
2. Anomalies in Retention
-	September and October Cohorts:
    -	The September cohort has an exceptionally high retention rate in Month 2 (12.52%), far exceeding earlier cohorts. However, this retention sharply declines in later months (9.67% in Month 3, with no data for subsequent months).
    -	Similarly, the October cohort exhibits the highest initial retention rate (14.58%) but lacks data beyond Month 2.
-	November Cohort:
    No retention data beyond Month 1, as it is still within the acquisition period.
-	The December cohort cannot be fully analyzed due to the short time frame (data only reflects a few days).
Interpretation:
The September and October cohorts likely benefited from strong acquisition campaigns, possibly tied to specific marketing efforts or seasonal promotions. However, the retention decline suggests a need for follow-up engagement strategies to sustain user activity.
3. Patterns of Retention Decline
-	Early Cohorts (January–June):
    -	The drop-off is relatively moderate, with retention stabilizing around 4–5% in later months.
    -	This stability indicates effective retention strategies but also highlights potential for further improvement in user engagement.
-	Later Cohorts (July–October):
    -	Higher initial retention rates (8–14%) suggest improvements in onboarding or engagement strategies during these periods.
Key Insights & Recommendations
    1.	Sustain Engagement for High-Performing Cohorts:
        -	Leverage insights from July–October cohorts to understand the factors driving their high initial retention (e.g., onboarding processes, targeted campaigns).
        -	Implement strategies to maintain retention beyond Month 3, such as loyalty programs, reactivation emails, or exclusive offers.
    2.	Focus on Long-Term Retention:
        -	For earlier cohorts (e.g., January–June), where retention stabilizes at 4–5%, consider enhancing re-engagement campaigns to boost long-term activity.
    3.	Address Retention Drop-Off in Later Cohorts:
        -	September and October cohorts show steep declines after Month 2. Focus on personalized engagement strategies during the critical second and third months to minimize drop-off.
    4.	Evaluate Marketing Efforts:
        -	The surge in Month 1 retention for later cohorts (e.g., October with 14.58%) indicates successful acquisition campaigns. Replicate these efforts while pairing them with sustained post-acquisition engagement strategies.

### Customer Segmentation RFM Analysis
![rfm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b5b517-83b0-4ce1-b5d3-8c9095f002b0)

1. Customer Segmentation Overview:
-	Recent Customers (40.46%):
    Customers who have made purchases recently. This segment offers significant opportunities for engagement through follow-up marketing campaigns to build loyalty.
-	Can't Lose Them (49.16%):
    The most valuable customers with high purchasing behavior (frequent and high-value purchases). They need to be retained through top-notch service and exclusive offers.
    -	At Risk (8,55%): 								           Spent big money and purhcase often, but long time ago. Need to bring them back.
    -	About to Sleep (1.43%):
Customers who are on the verge of inactivity. They need strong incentives to re-engage, such as big discounts or special programs.
    -	Champions (0.03%):
Top-performing customers who are highly loyal and active buyers. This segment is small but critical for long-term loyalty.

2. Data Interpretation:
-	Segment Dominance:
    The two largest segments are "Recent Customers" and "Can't Lose Them." This indicates the business should focus on these two groups:
    o	Ensuring Recent Customers remain engaged.
    o	Retaining customers in the "Can't Lose Them" category with strong loyalty strategies.
-	Rescue Opportunities:
    o	The "About to Sleep" segment (1.43%) needs attention as they are at risk of inactivity.
    o	Win-back campaigns such as re-engagement emails, special discounts, or loyalty incentives could be effective.
-	Attention to Champions:
    o	The number of customers in the Champions segment is very small (only 0.03%). This could indicate the need to investigate what causes customers to shift away from this category.

3. Strategic Recommendations:
    1.	For Recent Customers:
        o	Send thank-you emails, product recommendations, and offers to encourage second purchases.
        o	Provide a seamless purchasing experience to leave a positive impression.
    2.	For Can't Lose Them:
        o	Launch a loyalty program emphasizing rewards for their purchases.
        o	Offer exclusive deals and encourage them to try new products.
    3.	For About to Sleep:
        o	Analyze their previous purchase patterns to create personalized offers.
        o	Engage them with emotional campaigns, such as birthday greetings with vouchers or targeted ads.
    4.	For Champions:
        o	Review their data to identify behaviors that can be replicated with other customers.
        o	Use them as brand advocates by involving them in referral programs or customer testimonials.

Conclusion:
This RFM chart shows a balanced distribution with a strong focus on new and loyal customers. However, attention should also be directed toward the "About to Sleep" segment and efforts to increase the number of Champions.

Seasonality and Market Trends
-	Categories like Outerwear & Coats and Sweaters are likely to have demand patterns tied to the winter season. Efficient stocking strategies and timely promotions (e.g., ahead of winter) can maximize sales during peak periods.
-	Swim likely experiences seasonal demand during the summer, so marketing strategies should align with such trends.
________________________________________
 Conclusions and Recommendations
-	Dominant Categories: A majority of revenue comes from a few key categories (Outerwear & Coats, Jeans, Sweaters). Focusing on these categories will significantly impact overall business performance.
-	Short-Term Strategy:
    o	Maximize contributions from dominant categories through aggressive marketing strategies and product diversification.
    o	Launch special promotions for mid-level categories like Fashion Hoodies and Swim.
-	Long-Term Strategy:

### Revenue Distribution: Key Top 3 Categories and Their Dominant Brands
#### Jeans
![pareto jeans](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9f1ad7-b337-40a6-a419-82bf612cd44f)

1. The Pareto Principle (80/20) is Clearly Evident
    -	Total Revenue: A significant portion of the revenue comes from only a few top-performing brands.
    -	From the chart, approximately 80% of the revenue is generated by the 32 brands on 204 total brands.
    -	This aligns with the Pareto Principle, where a small number of categories contribute to the majority of the results.
2. Identifying Key Categories
    -	Top Contributors (High Revenue):
        o	7 For All Mankind ($76K, the largest contributor).
        o	True Religion ($53K).
        o	Diesel ($38K).
        o	These three brands alone account for around 50% of the total revenue.
    -	Mid-Level Contributors:
        o	Brands like Lucky Brand, Wrangler, and Not Your Daughter's Jeans contribute moderate revenue.
    -	Low-Level Contributors (Low Revenue):
        o	Brands such as Antique Rivet, RYCA, and AX Armani Exchange contribute minimally to the total revenue.
3. Prioritization Focus
    -	Optimization Focus:
        o	Prioritize managing top-contributing brands (e.g., offering promotions, better inventory management, or marketing strategies for these leading brands).
        o	Explore opportunities to boost the performance of mid-level brands, as their impact can grow significantly with better strategies.
    -	Evaluate Low-Performing Brands:
        o	For brands with small contributions (e.g., RYCA, Antique Rivet), assess whether they should remain in the portfolio or require a new approach to improve their performance.
4. Strategic Recommendations
        -	Maximize Top Brands: Focus on 7 For All Mankind, True Religion, and Diesel, as they are the major contributors. Strengthen inventory, pricing, and sales strategies for these brands.
        -	Grow Middle-Tier Brands: Conduct further analysis on mid-level brands to identify ways to increase their market share and revenue contribution.
        -	Reassess Bottom Brands: Consider whether to retain brands with minimal revenue contribution or replace them with more promising options.

![pareto outerwear](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82361ff1-6188-498e-9ed0-2fa18dc491c2)

1. The Pareto Principle (80/20) in Action
    -	Total Revenue: The majority of revenue is generated by a small group of brands on the chart.    
    -	Approximately 80% of the revenue is driven by the first 67 brands from 267 brands.

. Observations of the Pareto Principle
    -	Revenue Concentration: A small number of brands account for a significant portion of total revenue, though the distribution here appears less concentrated compared to the first two charts.
    -	The cumulative percentage line indicates that reaching 80% of total revenue requires contributions from more brands, suggesting a more even revenue distribution.
